OS Assignment

I have completed all the features, including the bonus ones.
The code has been written in a very modular fashion, specifically
for all commands such as ls, cd , echo, nightswatch, etc a new
file has been made by the name of the file. Other than those
files, there are three other files: main.c for starting the
terminal, prompt.c for basic input/output without processing and
exec_main for passing control over to the command files.

Also hist_file is used for storing history
